# High Blood Pressure Prediction with Lasso Regression

This project builds a multivariate regression model to predict blood pressure using health-related features from a diabetes dataset. It uses standard linear regression and Lasso regression for feature selection and model performance enhancement.

## 📊 Features Used
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## 🔧 Methods
- Data Cleaning (removal of invalid 0 values)
- Feature Standardization
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression with Cross-Validation
- Model Evaluation using RMSE, R², and PRESS statistic
- Residual Plot Analysis

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## 📈 Results
- Lasso regression was used to select the most impactful features.
- Evaluation included RMSE, R², cross-validation, and residual analysis.

## 📁 File
- `Lasso_Reg.ipynb`: Main notebook with full code and analysis.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open `Lasso_Reg.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells in order
